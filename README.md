# *Spy* Party Game
## 3+ players

Enter the number of players and take turns privately revealing the topic to each player, one of the players is a spy.

Once everyone except the spy knows the topic, take turns asking each other questions about the topic to try to figure out who the spy is.

Don't reveal too much information or the Spy may find out what the secret topic is!

## Example - 3 Players

*Topic is 'Grocery Store'*

*Player 2 is the spy*

P1: *"Hey P3, would you spend more than an hour there?"*

P3: *"Probably. Hey P2, would you go on a date here?"*

P2: *"Yes."*

P1 and P3: *"P2, you're the spy!"*
